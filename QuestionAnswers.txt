What process did you follow for creating the dockerfile?
I created my dockerfile using the same process shown in class. I defined
the image 'type' that's to be built. I ran a mkdir command to create a folder
for the server app, set the container inside the directory, copied all the necessary 
files and folders from my flask app, and lastly exposed it to the correct port. 

What docker commands did you use to run the image?
I built the docker image on my machine locally, tagged it, then I created my own
docker hub account and pushed my image onto the hub, similar process to pushing repositories with github. 
I pulled the image from my docker hub onto the server and ran the containerized app from there.
